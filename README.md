**Course:** Introduction to Neural Networks - January 2021

**Score:** 60/60

## Project Summary
To help the operations team identify the customers that are more likely to churn by building an artificial Neural Network from scratch.

### Skills and Tools
Tensorflow, Keras, ANN, Google colab

## Project Description

### Objective:

Given a Bank customer, build a neural network-based classifier that can determine whether they will leave or not in the next 6 months.

#### Context:

Businesses like banks that provide service have to worry about the problem of 'Churn' i.e. customers leaving and joining another service provider. It is important to understand which aspects of the service influence a customer's decision in this regard. Management can concentrate efforts on the improvement of service, keeping in mind these priorities.

#### Data Description:

The case study is from an open-source dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 10,000 sample points with 14 distinct features such as CustomerId, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, etc.

- RowNumber: Row number.
- CustomerId: Unique identification key for different customers.
- Surname: Surname of the customer
- Credit Score: Credit score is a measure of an individual's ability to pay back the borrowed amount. It is the numerical representation of their creditworthiness. A credit score is a 3-digit number that falls in the range of 300-900, 900 being the highest.
